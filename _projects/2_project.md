In this work, we trained self-supervised representation learning model (Contrastive Predictive Coding) on:

1. child-centered long-form recordings (acquired with child-worn microphones)
  
2. audiobooks (clean read-speech commonly used in self-supervised representation learning)
   
3. simulated long-forms, that are audiobooks contaminated with additive noise and reverberation.

Below, you'll find some audio samples that the model is exposed to during training.

### Child-centered long-form recordings

Audio samples extracted from child-centered long-form recordings:
